# Coursebuilder Import Unit Lesson Module

## Introduction
This module was designed for copying lessons from one unit or course to another. This is a standalone module and can be attached to any GCB application.

You'll need a system with current versions of `bash` and `git`, as well as
`python` 2.7.

## Getting started

First, clone the Code for Africa Course Builder Repository and change directory to the Course Builder root:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CodeForAfricaLabs/coursebuilder-core
```

Course Builder provides a management script for fetching standalone modules, you can grab the Course Builder, then using it to fetch this module`coursebuilder-unit-lesson-copy`.

### Installation

- Make sure you have your `bash` window opened.
- Next step is to cd into the coursebuilder directory like so
```sh
cd coursebuilder-core/coursebuilder
```
- Once you are in the coursebuilder directory, run the script below to fetch this module
```sh
sh scripts/modules.sh \
  --targets=coursebuilder-unit-lesson-copy@https://github.com/andela-johia/coursebuilder-import-unit-lesson
```

- This will both download the module and link it to Course Builder. Now you can start up Course Builder with this module installed:
```sh
sh scripts/start_in_shell.sh
```

In order to view this module in action, visit `localhost:8081/import`.

### `scripts/setup.sh`

When you run `modules.sh` from Course Builder, it fetches this module  and then invokes this script. This script is responsible for linking the module's
`src` and `tests` directories into the right places in your local Course Builder
filesystem (`coursebuilder/modules/coursebuilder-unit-lesson-copy` and
`coursebuilder/tests/ext/coursebuilder-unit-lesson-copy`, respectively).


## Working with this module

After you've downloaded and installed this module, start Course Builder normally
to use it:

```sh
sh scripts/start_in_shell.sh
```
### Steps to working effectively with this module

After starting starting the Coursebuilder and navigating to `localhost:8081/import`, use the following steps to ensure maximum usage:
 - There are two input fields present. The first one is the `from-lesson` input field and the second is the `to-lesson` input field.
 - Go to the admin dashboard and create an empty lesson.
 - Open a second tab on your browser and navigate to the `URLs` of the lesson you want copied and copied to.
 - Ensure to copy its full URL. The URL path is like so `<your-server>/<course>/unit?unit=<number>&lesson=<number>`
 - Add the  copied URLs to their respective input fields in the import page
 - Click the import button.
 - Navigate to the lesson that was copied to.

### Running tests

You can run specific tests with `test.sh`, which is in `coursebuilder/scripts`.
For example, after you've installed this module, you can run all its tests from
the Course Builder root with:

```sh
sh scripts/test.sh tests.ext.coursebuilder-unit-lesson-copy.functional_tests
```
